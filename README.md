# Ayna ML Assignment

This project is part of the Ayna ML Internship Assignment.  
It involves building a deep learning model (UNet) that takes a polygon image and a color name as input and outputs the same polygon filled with the specified color.

## Problem Statement

- **Input:**  
  1. Polygon image (e.g., triangle, square)  
  2. Color name (e.g., "red", "blue")

- **Output:**  
  RGB image of the polygon filled with the given color

## Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Weights & Biases (wandb)
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run the Project
### 1. Set up environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Download the dataset
Link: Download dataset (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QXLgo3ZfQPorGwhYVmZUEWO_sU3i1pHM/view)
Extract it into the data/ folder

3. Train the model
python src/train.py
This trains the UNet model and saves it as models/unet_colored_polygon.pth

4. Test the model
jupyter notebook notebooks/inference.ipynb

This will show:
Input polygon
Ground truth
Predicted colored polygon

üìå Notes
.pth model file is ignored in Git due to size limits
The dataset is not included in the repo ‚Äî download manually
The project works on both Google Colab and local Ubuntu setup
